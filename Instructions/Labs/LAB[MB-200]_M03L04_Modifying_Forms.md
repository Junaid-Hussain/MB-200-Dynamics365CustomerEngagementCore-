Module 3: Building Model-Driven Applications
============================================

## Lesson 4: Practice Lab – Modifying forms

Scenario
--------

You are a functional consultant for your organization Contoso. You are assigned
to work on a project for your client Fabrikam. In this practice you will be
continuing your work on the model-driven Knowledge Admin app. In this practice,
you will be modifying the auto generated forms to add the new fields you added
in the data-modeling practice.

Exercise 1 – Edit the Knowledge Assessment Form 
------------------------------------------------

In this exercise, you will edit the form for the Knowledge Assessment Table.
There are two places you can edit this from, either from the Solutions > Table > Forms list, or via the App Designer. If you are already in App
Designer start, there.

### Task 1 – Enable Notes on the Knowledge Assessment entity

Initially when the Table was created notes were not enabled. Since then the
client Fabrikam has determined that they like to be able to track notes against
the knowledge assessments. We are going to make this change before getting into
the form editor, because this is the easiest way to perform these configuration steps. The same is true, for
example, if you need to add any columns: you should always try to add the columns
before jumping into the editor.

1.  Navigate to <https://make.powerapps.com>

2.  Make sure you are in the **Practice** environment you created.

3.  Select **Solutions**.

4.  Open the **Common Data Service Default Solution**.

5.  Click on the **Knowledge Assessment** Table.

6.  Click **Settings** in the command bar.

    the table.

### Task 2 – Edit the Knowledge Assessment form
